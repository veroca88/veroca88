## Hi, I'm Veronica

#### Full-Stack Web Developer

Always I've had that desire of create things, It is fascinating how we can take an idea, carefully following each step within the development process and transformed it in a solution to our daily living.

During my non-tech roles I learned a lot about team work, production line, give solution to user needs, time management and (of course) problem solving.

As a full-stack web developer I really enjoy doing request, work with the data saved on the data base and then get that data to the client side is like magic.

I'm always learning and discovering new ways of doing things!

My favorites? mountains, coding, music, my family!
