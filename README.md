## Hi, I'm Veronica

I've always had that desire to create things. It is fascinating how we can take an idea, carefully following each step within the development process and transform it into a solution to our daily living.

During my journey I've learned a lot about teamwork, production line, giving solutions to user and business needs,  time management and (of course) problem solving.

My skills span across full-stack development, allowing me to tackle a wide range of projects. I'm always learning and discovering new ways of doing things!

My favorites? mountains, coding, music, my family!
